# Why OOP is Required? ðŸš€

**OOP makes software development efficient, scalable, and secure! ðŸš€**

## Key Benefits of OOP

1. **Code Reusability** â€“ Use **inheritance** to reduce redundancy.
2. **Modularity & Maintainability** â€“ Organized code in **classes & objects** for easy updates.
3. **Encapsulation (Data Security)** â€“ Restrict unauthorized access to data.
4. **Scalability & Flexibility** â€“ Easily add new features without modifying existing code.
5. **Polymorphism** â€“ Methods behave differently based on object type.
6. **Real-World Modeling** â€“ OOP maps real-world entities like `Car`, `User`, or `BankAccount`.
