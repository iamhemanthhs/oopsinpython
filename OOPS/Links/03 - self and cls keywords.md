### `self` Keyword:
The self keyword in Python is used to represent the instance of the class. It allows you to access the instance variables and methods within the class. Although self is not a reserved keyword in Python, it is a widely accepted convention.

#### Example of self:
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make  # Instance variable
        self.model = model  # Instance variable
        self.year = year  # Instance variable

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")
```

# Creating an object of the Car class
```python
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
```

# Accessing instance methods
```python
car1.display_info()  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla
```

### cls Keyword:
The cls keyword is used to refer to the class itself, not the instance. It is typically used in class methods, which are methods that operate on the class rather than on individual instances. The first parameter in class methods must be cls (although you can technically name it anything else, cls is the convention).


#### Example of cls:
```python
class Car:
    # Class variable (shared by all instances)
    wheels = 4

    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} has {self.wheels} wheels.")

    @classmethod
    def change_wheels(cls, new_wheel_count):
        # Using cls to modify a class variable
        cls.wheels = new_wheel_count

# Creating objects of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2021)

# Accessing class variables using the class name
print(f"Before change: Car1 has {Car.wheels} wheels.")  # Output: 4
print(f"Before change: Car2 has {Car.wheels} wheels.")  # Output: 4

# Changing class variable using class method
Car.change_wheels(6)

# After changing the class variable
print(f"After change: Car1 has {Car.wheels} wheels.")  # Output: 6
print(f"After change: Car2 has {Car.wheels} wheels.")  # Output: 6
```

### Why Use self and cls?
- **self**: Allows each instance to store its own data, making objects distinct from one another. It is essential for working with instance-specific attributes and methods.
- **cls**: Helps in modifying class variables that are shared by all instances. It is used when you want to define methods that act on the class itself, rather than on individual objects.

### Conclusion:
- Use self to refer to the instance in instance methods, accessing and modifying instance variables.
- Use cls to refer to the class in class methods, allowing you to work with class variables and methods that affect the entire class.
